    <h2><u>Ordered list of HTML tags-</u></h2>
    <br>

    <ol>
        <li>Anchor tag </li>
            <p>In short, this is a tag that helps you make a link to a web page, to your page, social media site, product within online store,... The main attribute for this HTML tag is the href (Hypertext Reference) attribute, where you put a link to a website you want to link to. The other attribute is target, it can be used to open a link in a new window, so that users don’t lose focus on the current page. 
            </p>
        
        <li>  Bold text tag</li>
            <p>If you have a lot of text, then you need to emphasise some words to let the reader know what is important. And you do that with <b>bold parts of the text</b>.</p>


        <li> Div tag</li>
            <p>An element which is mostly used to group elements and to act as a template for new controls. The div HTML tag is an element you will use to divide a significant part of an HTML document from other parts. For examplle, let’s say you have a list of products on your web page, you will use a div for each product.</p>  
            
            
        <li>Heading tags</li>
            <p>H1   H2 ... H6 </p>
            <p>Headings (levels 1-6, i.e. H3 is a subheading within a H2 subheading). <u> H1, H2,... tags are used to create titles</u>. Why do we need titles, when we can style a text to look like H tags? For instance, titles are used so that search engines and other scrapers (bots) understand the important parts of our documents.</p> 
            
        <li>Img tag</li>  
            <p>We <b> use the IMG tag to show images</b>. Considering that images can be within files for your web page or anywhere online. In addition, the most important attribute is src (source), which tells where the picture is</p> 
            
        <li>Span tag</li>
        <p>The span tag groups text for which we <b>want to have different styling.</b> </p>

        

    </ol>
