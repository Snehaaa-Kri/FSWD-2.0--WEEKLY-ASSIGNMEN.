        <Strong>What is CSS?</Strong> <br>
        
        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a markup language responsible for how your web pages will look like. It controls the colors, fonts, and layouts of your website elements.

        This style sheet language also allows you to add effects or animations to your website. You can use it to display some CSS animations like click button effects, spinners or loaders, and animated backgrounds.</p>

        <h2>Types of CSS:</h2>
        The three types of CSS: internal, external, and inline.

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Internal or embedded</strong> ⁠— add style tag in the head section of HTML document </li>

            <li><strong>External</strong> ⁠— link the HTML sheet to a separate .css file</li>

            <li><strong>Inline</strong> ⁠— apply CSS rules for specific elements.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        <h2>Why use CSS?</h2>

        <ol>
            <li> <h3>Solves a big problem</h3>
                Before CSS, tags like font, color, background style, element alignments, border and size had to be repeated on every web page. This was a very long process. For example: If you are developing a large website where fonts and color information are added on every single page, it will be become a long and expensive process. CSS was created to solve this problem. It was a W3C recommendation.</li>
            <li> <h3>Saves a lot of time</h3>
                CSS style definitions are saved in external CSS files so it is possible to change the entire website by changing just one file.</li>
            <li> <h3>Provide more attributes</h3>
                CSS provides more detailed attributes than plain HTML to define the look and feel of the website.</li>
        </ol>
